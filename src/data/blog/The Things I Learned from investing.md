**I must be honest, I didn't receive any systematic knowledge and practical training, and there's so much I don't know. It will be a long journey, but I think I will enjoy it.**

## My Personal Story

I felt that starting from my own experience would make this easier to write. If I only wrote about “what I learned,” I would not know where to begin.

My journey started during the winter break of my first year of undergraduate study. I was 19. One day, I was scrolling on social media and saw a video where a creator said that if she could recommend only one investment tool, it would be an index fund. I was curious. What exactly was an index fund?

I started researching immediately and began reading books about investing. Not long after that, I invested some money in the Chinese stock market. That year was the first year of COVID. By coincidence, I entered the market very close to a market low. After that, prices kept rising. In less than three months, I sold my holdings. The market looked great, many people were entering, and very soon I bought back in. I also started buying different sector ETFs that I did not understand. Almost everything was going up.

At the same time, I kept reading and learning about funds. I learned about dollar-cost averaging. I was still relatively clear-headed 😇. I knew that I did not really understand what I was doing, so I did not invest much. I only invested a few hundred at the beginning. Looking back, I am very grateful that I did that.

**Nothing goes up forever. No stock market, and no stock, can keep rising endlessly. In the long run, prices always move back toward their underlying value. This is an objective rule.**

After almost a year of a bull market, prices started to fall slowly. At first, most people believed this was a great opportunity to buy more. I felt the same. At that time, it was very obvious that many people had entered the stock market. Everyone was talking about it. You could feel how strong the trend was, and how it influenced ordinary people.

Later, I realized that this is often a signal that you should start selling, or at least be careful. You should especially not expect to sell at the perfect time. You can’t. If you try to time it perfectly, your greed may take over.

In the end, I lost around one to two thousand. It was not a large amount, but it was the first time I truly felt that my money was gone because of my own mistakes. That negative return stayed in my account. It felt terrible.

During that period, I still kept learning, although not consistently. Gradually, I formed my own very simple strategy: regularly invest in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, and do not sell. That was it.

I also kept some bonds and adjusted my investment amounts from time to time. I sold small portions occasionally, and later realized I should not have sold them. These were lessons I needed to experience myself. I think they were worth it.

At the beginning of 2025, I became more interested in the business world itself. I started learning more about it. That year, I mainly read books by Charlie Munger, biographies of Warren Buffett, and books by Duan Yongping and Li Lu. I also started learning about the mental models that Munger talked about. There is so much to learn. I am taking it slowly.

## The Things I Learned

### General Lessons

Find the rules and build your own circle of competence. You cannot catch every opportunity. What matters more is knowing which ones you _can_ catch, and avoiding major mistakes.

Build a sufficient margin of safety. Learn how to wait. When real opportunities appear, you should be willing to invest more decisively. This sounds simple, but it is extremely difficult in practice.

Avoid speculation. In the end, money becomes just numbers. Speculation usually does not offer a good trade-off between risk and return.

When people say “this time is different,” it is usually enough to listen politely and move on. Events change, but objective rules do not. Always respect those rules.

If you truly do not know what to do, regularly investing in the S&P 500 or Berkshire Hathaway may be a reasonable temporary choice? 

Most importantly, keep learning and enjoy the learning process. Accumulate knowledge slowly and let it compound over time. Being able to rely on your own understanding and judgment is the most fascinating part.

### Lessons from the Chinese Stock Market

In recent years, interest rates have been significantly lowered, combined with various policies aimed at stimulating consumption. I remember writing at the time that under such conditions, asset prices—such as real estate and stocks—would likely rise significantly. And it was clear that real estate prices were unlikely to rise again.

However, I had been hurt by the Chinese stock market before.🤣 I remained skeptical and did not invest. Looking back now, I think I should have bought. When assets are undervalued, it makes sense to invest carefully. When they are extremely undervalued, it may be reasonable to invest more boldly. I noticed that but chose to do nothing.

Although I missed that broader market cycle, in the summer of 2025 I noticed that the Chinese baijiu sector was performing extremely poorly. I checked valuations and found that they were close to historical lows. I bought in for a few days, and looking back, it seems I entered near the bottom.

The Chinese baijiu industry has been in a long-term downward trend, but at that time, policy restrictions were especially strict and had a strong impact on certain industries, including baijiu. This helped me realize an important rule:

**When a specific policy severely affects the stock prices of an industry, you should either be cautious of overvaluation or be brave in buying undervalued assets. Such policy impacts are rarely permanent. In the end, prices return to the company’s fundamental value.**
