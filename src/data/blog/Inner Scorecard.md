## Why Inner Scorecard?

This post may seem unrelated or unnecessary, but it actually means a lot to me.

I want to write about the idea of an **Inner Scorecard**. For me, building my own evaluation system is extremely important. Knowing what I want, what I don’t want, and choosing my own direction with clarity and commitment matters deeply to me.

Some time ago, I read about Warren Buffett’s concept of the Inner Scorecard. When I came across it, I realized it was very similar to what I had been trying to do all along — building my own standards instead of living by external ones. 

Recently, as I’m preparing to look for jobs and complete my thesis, I know I may face rejection and negative feedback. **I want to remind myself in advance: those outcomes do not define who I am. I already know the kind of person I am becoming. Almost every day, I am making progress. I will get there — and Just enjoy the process and keep going.**

This idea sounds simple, but I don’t think many people truly live this way. That’s why I want to explain how this came into my mind.

## Living on Default Paths

Many of us live inside certain patterns without even realizing it. At least, that was true for me.

Study hard.  
Go to a good university.  
Find a good job.  
Find a partner, build a family, have at least one child.

This was the life path presented to me, and I indeed followed it without questioning. I went to a good university and entered medical school. Since both of my parents are doctors, I never doubted that I would not good at it. I had always done well in school, so I assumed medicine was the right path for me.

Of course, I know academic performance does not equal intelligence. Many people are simply not suited to this kind of education system, and that does not make them less capable. But when you personally go through it, it is not easy. You doubt yourself again and again. In China especially, students are judged almost entirely by grades. The obsession with scores is toxic, and it exists at a societal level. You simply can't resist it.

Gradually, I accepted a difficult truth: I did not want to continue medical training. This realization took almost my entire medical school journey. During that process, I became clearer about what I didn’t want, what I might want, and what truly mattered to me.

In the end, I gave up the opportunity to pursue medical residency and chose to go abroad. I was the only person in my cohort who made that decision🥲.

## Choosing My Own Life

We only live once, and that is exactly what makes life beautiful.

Many people didn’t understand my decision. Some openly opposed it. Even today, my parents still don’t fully understand why I walked away from becoming a doctor. But for me, it was worth it.

If everyone follows the same default path, what meaning does my life have? Are those socially accepted paths really what I want? I thought deeply about this. If I continued along the path of least resistance, my life would probably be fine — but would it truly be good?

I define myself as an optimistic and positive person. When I look back at my past journals, I’m surprised by how much negativity I once carried. Over time, I learned what I truly value: time freedom, being present for the people I love, and living with intention.

I also learned what I’m good at. I’m strong at information gathering, execution, communication, coordination, and adapting to change. I learn new fields quickly, enjoy interdisciplinary thinking, and genuinely like encouraging others to pursue their goals. I could keep going, but that might sound like bragging 😄.

At the same time, I’m not good at long hours of detailed paperwork, constant error-checking, or maintaining high energy for repetitive tasks. I only learned these things about myself after stepping outside the exam-oriented system and redirecting my time and attention elsewhere. That’s when I truly started to understand who I am and what kind of life I want to live.

## Why an Inner Scorecard Matters

Without my own evaluation system — without an Inner Scorecard — I would always live according to others’ expectations. I would drift without direction.

Many people live this way, and it’s not necessarily wrong. Following the mainstream path can be a valid choice. For example, many of my classmates want to pursue a PhD because it has become a requirement for entering top hospitals. Personally, I don’t think that alone is a good reason to do a PhD. Others want to become civil servants because the job is stable, their parents love it, the economic environment feels uncertain.

I’m not criticizing these choices. My point is simply: if you always follow external expectations and never build your own inner standards, there will never be a moment of true satisfaction. A good university leads to pressure for a good job. A good job leads to expectations for a perfect family. There is no finish line where everyone around you is finally satisfied.

## My Personal Inner Scorecard

I know I’m still young, I have a lot more to explore, and many mistakes ahead of me. But I’ve already built a basic Inner Scorecard for myself.

### My core principles:

1. Maintain physical and mental health: sleep well, eat nourishing food, and exercise.
    
2. Give time to the people who matter to me: regularly call my parents, stay connected with friends at home and abroad, practice gratitude, and learn to give.
    
3. Read and write for at least two hours a day. Any topic, any field. If time is limited, even 20 minutes is enough.
    

I can honestly say I’m doing well on these. According to my own standards, I’m proud of myself.

### My secondary principles:

1. Learn languages and truly experience the cultures behind them, especially while living in English- and French-speaking environments.
    
2. Actively create connections with people: start conversations, learn others’ stories, practice self-presentation, network, ask for opportunities, and create them instead of waiting.
    
3. Create value for others and aim to have a positive impact, whether in real life or online. Focus less on what I can get, and more on what I can offer.
    
4. Avoid complaining. Stay optimistic. Distance myself from negativity and from people whose values don’t align with mine.

This is my Inner Scorecard — or rather, my exploration guide for life. I can’t say I follow it perfectly every day, but most of the time, I genuinely try. And because of that, I feel content with my life.

Everyone has a different path. I hope I can continue practicing mine. My story is still unfolding — and I hope we can all gradually build and trust our own Inner Scorecards.🙌
