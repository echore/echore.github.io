#  Business Basics: The Core Formula

Learned from the Internet videos


---

## First Impression

This speaker is genuinely good at teaching. He speaks clearly, has strong flow, and knows how to keep people engaged. I should learn from him.

## The Essence of Business

The core formula of business is simple:

**Profit = Revenue − Cost**

Everyone knows this formula. But knowing the formula is not the same as understanding it.

He gave a simple example. His friend is a beautiful tiktok influencer. Her “skill” is just dancing, and it works. He cannot copy that and succeed. 

So the point is not the tactic, but the underlying logic.

**The real key is the match between one’s unique advantage and market demand.**

## How Companies Actually Make Money

If a company wants to make money, it has only two levers:

- expand revenue
    
- control costs
    

### What Drives Revenue?

Revenue comes from marketing. Only when consumers accept you will they buy from you.

### What Controls Costs?

Cost control comes from management.

- Did you reach your goal? That is effectiveness.
    
- How did you reach it? That is efficiency.
    

Higher efficiency leads to higher effectiveness.

## Human Desire Is a Good Thing in Business

Human desire is endless, and in business this is a positive force.

We moved from simply eating enough, to caring about taste, then service, then experience. There are always new needs to discover and satisfy. This creates new business models and new opportunities.

**There are always new chances in business.**

---

## Revenue vs. Cost: Which Matters More?

In theory, revenue has no upper limit. Cost control always has a ceiling.

That is why making money is often more important than saving money.

However, this needs context. He mentioned fast-growing e-commerce companies like YiXun. They grew quickly but disappeared. JD, by contrast, invested heavily in management and talent development. At some point, JD was no longer short of money.

This logic is especially true in the early explosive growth stage. Later, the balance changes.

---

## Growth Stage vs. Maturity Stage

A single product or a single business line will eventually hit a ceiling.

When revenue can no longer grow rapidly, management becomes more important. This is the transition from growth to maturity.

Most business schools focus on management systems. They are good at maintaining success, but not at creating it. They prepare people for large, established companies, not for early-stage entrepreneurship.

If a company is in a growth phase, **sales matter the most**. The priority is rapid revenue expansion.

---

## The Corporate Life Cycle

He described four stages:

1. **Adaptation stage** – verify that real market demand exists
    
2. **Growth stage** – expand revenue aggressively
    
3. **Maturity stage** – management becomes central
    
4. **Decline stage** – layoffs and contraction
    

You can often tell a company’s stage by which roles dominate:

- Sales-heavy → likely in growth
    
- Management-heavy → likely mature
    
- HR with strong power → often in decline

## The Second Growth Curve

Some companies seem to have no revenue ceiling.

Why? Because when the first product reaches its peak, they already start building the second product. This is the idea of a **second growth curve**.

A key strategic question is:

**What resources am I building now that will give me a major advantage in the next opportunity?**

Companies like Tencent and Amazon did not know their most profitable paths at the beginning. They experimented. They had a direction, but not a fixed path.

---

## Marketing: Making Selling Unnecessary

One sentence stood out:

**Marketing is about making selling unnecessary.**

Apple and Coca-Cola are classic examples.

Revenue can be simplified as:

**Price × Quantity**

- High price, low quantity → luxury goods
    
- Low price, high quantity → Coca-Cola
    
- High price, no quantity → no business
    
- No price, high quantity → platforms like Tiktok
    

Having many users does not prevent commercial success.

No company dislikes having many customers. The only concern is gaining volume at the cost of brand damage, such as luxury brands discounting heavily.

---

## Quantity and Market Size

Quantity depends on:

- number of customers
    
- frequency of consumption
    

Customer count = new customers − lost customers

Attracting new customers, retaining old ones, and encouraging repeat consumption—this is marketing.

Before entering an industry, you must ask: how big is the market? Choosing a large enough industry and a large enough customer base is a strategic decision. This requires vision, and it is difficult.

---

## The True Meaning of Profit

Profit is a means, not the goal.

Profit ensures sustainability, but it is not the only source of money. Companies can also survive through external funding. Investors care about stock appreciation, not just profit distribution.

Amazon is clear example.

So what is the real purpose of business?

**Without customers, there is no business.**

The only true purpose of business is to create customers.

At its core, business is about satisfying customer needs in a way that benefits the company. “Benefit” here does not only mean profit, but everything that strengthens the firm.
