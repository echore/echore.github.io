# [Mental Model: Feedback Loops](https://fs.blog/mental-model-feedback-loops/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

>There are two types of feedback loops: positive and negative. Positive feedback amplifies system output, resulting in growth or decline. Negative feedback dampers output, stabilizes the system around an equilibrium point.

>**A key lesson of feedback loops is that things are connected**—changing one variable in a system will affect other variables in that system and other systems. This is important because it means that designers must not only consider particular elements of a design, but also their relation to the design as a whole and to the greater environment.

# [Homeostasis and Why We Backslide](https://fs.blog/why-do-we-backslide-on-our-goals/)

>The problem is that homeostasis, like [natural selection](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/01/natural-selection-of-chain-letters/) and like [life itself](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/04/should-vs-is/), is undirected and does not have a “value system” — it doesn’t keep what’s good and reject what’s bad. It’s just like **inertia**: It’s a simple algorithim that keeps things in motion as they were.

>**1. Be aware of the way homeostasis works.** This might be the most important guideline of all. Expect resistance and backlash. Realize that when the alarm bells start ringing, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re sick or crazy or lazy or that you’ve made a bad decision in embarking on the journey of mastery. In fact, you might take these signals as an indication that your life is definitely changing—just what you’ve wanted. Of course, it might be that you have started something that’s not right for you; only you can decide. But in any case, don’t panic and give up at the first sign of trouble. 

>**2. Be willing to negotiate with your resistance to change.** So what should you do when you run into resistance, when the red lights flash and the alarm bells ring? Well, you don’t back off, and you don’t bull your way through. Negotiation is the ticket to successful long-term change in everything from increasing your running speed to transforming your organization.

>**3. Develop a support system.** You can do it alone, but it helps a great deal to have other people with whom you can share the joys and perils of the change you’re making. The best support system would involve people who have gone through or are going through a similar process, people who can tell their own stories of change and listen to yours, people who will brace you up when you start to backslide and encourage you when you don’t. The path of mastery, fortunately, almost always fosters social groupings.

>**4. Follow a regular practice**. People embarking on any type of change can gain stability and comfort through practicing some worthwhile activity on a more or less regular basis, not so much for the sake of achieving an external goal as simply for its own sake.

>**5. Dedicate yourself to lifelong learning.** We tend to forget that learning is much more than book learning. To learn is to change. Education, whether it involves books, body, or behavior, is a process that changes the learner. It doesn’t have to end at college graduation or at age forty or sixty or eighty, and the best learning of all involves learning how to learn— that is, to change. The lifelong learner is essentially one who has learned to deal with homeostasis, simply because he or she is doing it all the time. The Dabbler, Obsessive, and Hacker are all learners in their own fashion, but lifelong learning is the special province of those who travel the path of mastery, the path that never ends.

I like these advice!

Reflections:
There are two feedback loops, negative or positive. 
We can use them both for ourselves, for negative, like market bubble, we can take advantage of it. what else?
For positive , when we try to build new habits, be aware of negative feedback loops, just take time dont be rush; and try to use some incentives to create positive feedback loops.
other applications?
