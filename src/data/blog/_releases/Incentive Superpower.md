[The Power of Incentives: The Hidden Forces That Shape Behavior](https://fs.blog/bias-incentives-reinforcement/#:~:text=The%20Power%20of%20Incentives%3A%20The,us%20to%20make%20major%20errors.)

> If we don’t like the consequences of an action we’ve taken, we’re less likely to do it again; if we do like the consequences, we’re more likely to do it again. That assumption is the basis of operant conditioning, “a type of learning in which the strength of a behavior is modified by [its] consequences, such as reward or punishment.”

> Psychologists argue that the best way for us to learn complex behaviors is via **continuous reinforcement**, in which the desired behavior is reinforced every time it’s performed.
> 
> If you want to teach your dog a new trick, for example, it is smart to reward him for every correct response. At the very beginning of the learning curve, your failure to immediately respond to a positive behavior might be misinterpreted as a sign of incorrect behavior from the dog’s perspective.

> **Intermittent reinforcement** is reinforcement that is given only some of the times that the desired behavior occurs, and it can be done according to various schedules, some predictable and some not

>intermittent reinforcement is better from an economic perspective. Not only is it cheaper not to reward every instance of a desired behavior, but by making the rewards unpredictable, you trigger excitement and thus get an increase in response without increasing the amount of reinforcement. Intermittent reinforcement is how casinos work; they want people to gamble, but they can’t afford to have people win large amounts very often.

## Scheduling Reinforcement

>1. Fixed-ratio schedules are used when you pay your employees based on the amount of work they do. Fixed-ratio schedules are common in freelancing, where contractors are paid on a piecework basis. Managers like fixed-ratio schedules because the response to reinforcement is usually very high (if you want to get paid, you do the work).
>   
>2. Variable-ratio schedules are unpredictable because the number of responses between reinforcers varies. Telemarketers, salespeople, and slot machine players are on this schedule because they never know when the next sale or the next big win will occur.
>   
>3. Fixed-interval schedules are the most common type of payment — they reward people for the time spent on a specific task. You might have already guessed that the response rate on this schedule is very low. Ironically, the “9-5 job” is a preferred way to reward employees in business.

## What About Punishment?
 
 >the power of punishment to suppress behavior usually disappears when the threat of punishment is removed
 
 >punishment often triggers a fight-or-flight response and renders us aggressive.

>punishment inhibits the ability to learn new and better responses. Punishment leads to a variety of responses — such as escape, aggression, and learned helplessness — none of which aid in the subject’s learning process. Punishment also fails to show subjects what exactly they must do and instead focuses on what not to do. This is why environments that forgive failure are so important in the learning process.
 
 >punishment is often applied unequally
 
 
## What Should I Do Instead?

> The first we already touched upon — **extinction**. A response will usually diminish or disappear if it ceases to produce the rewards it once did.

> The second alternative is **positively reinforcing preferred activities**.The main principle of this idea is that a preferred activity, such as running around, can be used to reinforce a less preferred activity. This idea is also called the Premack principle.

>Finally, **prompting and shaping** are two actions we can use together to change behavior in an iterative manner. A prompt is a cue or stimulus that encourages the desired behavior. When shaping begins, any approximation of the target response is reinforced.

Reflection:
- **Design what you reward**: People don’t do what you _say_ — they do what you _reward_.  And they won’t always “know” what you want — you have to make it clear through the incentives.
- Align rewards with the outcome you want
- **Intermittent reinforcement** is powerful, if you wanna motive people, maybe you can use this trick. like pinduoduo, you never know what time will be the $100 reward, so you just try again and agin.......
- Punishment ≠ Learning → Create Safe-to-Fail Environments
- Shaping is the process of guiding someone toward a complex or desired behavior by **rewarding smaller steps** along the way. 
- Duolingo: User opens the app, prompt like: “🔥 You’re on a 3-day streak! Let’s keep going?”

- **Incentives run the world** — from economics to social policies.
    
- But **they’re often poorly designed**, leading to unintended consequences.
    
- Many systems fail because people **don’t consider what behaviors they're actually rewarding**.

I like this example:
**Mexico City's Smog Law**
- Rule banned driving one day/week based on license plate numbers.
    
- People bought **extra cheap, polluting cars** to get around it.
    
- Made air quality **worse**, not better.

## [Incentive theory](https://youtu.be/vr9k-TO1_Zc?si=C1nE1HyMW2u_-q3G)

> **Incentive Theory** explains that behavior is motivated by the **desire for rewards**—either **tangible** (e.g., money, promotion) or **intangible** (e.g., pride, satisfaction).

**Core Principle**

- A **reward is given after an action**, with the goal of **increasing the likelihood** that the behavior will happen again.
    
- The key idea is assigning **positive meaning** to the behavior.

**Key Characteristics**

1. **Positive Reinforcement Focus**
    
    - Incentive theory emphasizes **positive reinforcement**: rewarding behavior to encourage repetition.
        
    - It is **not** about **negative reinforcement** (i.e., removing punishment).
        
2. **Timing Matters**
    
    - Rewards are most effective when given **immediately** after the behavior.
        
3. **Achievability**
    
    - Rewards must be **perceived as attainable**; otherwise, motivation decreases.
        
4. **Continuous Stimulation**
    
    - Positive reinforcement must be **consistent and ongoing** to maintain behavior.
