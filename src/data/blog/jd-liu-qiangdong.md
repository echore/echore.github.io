## How I Started Learning About JD.com and Liu Qiangdong

Learning about JD.com and its founder, Liu Qiangdong, actually started by accident. I was browsing Bilibili and came across a short interview he gave decades ago. In just a few minutes, he explained why Amazon’s Kindle model was unlikely to succeed in China. His reasoning was clear, and his business instincts were sharp.

I was so curious, so I watched another video—a nearly forty-minute speech he gave at Oxford. In it, he explained his personal story in detail. His public speaking was strong, well structured, and easy to follow.

## First Impressions vs. Reality

Before reading more, I mainly had negative impressions of him: JD’s “brother culture,” the Minnesota rape incident, and a very masculine, even patriarchal image.

After reading a book based on his own narration, those impressions did not disappear. If anything, they became clearer. He really is that kind of person and even didn’t realize that was a problem.

That said, his business ability and long-term vision are undeniable. Knowledge is still worth learning from.

## Early Ability: Seeing the Trend and Acting Fast

Chronologically speaking, Liu is clearly extremely intelligent and hardworking.

Studying sociology at Renmin University was clearly the wrong choice for him, but he realized this quickly. Instead of following the usual path of switching majors, he taught himself programming in the 1990s. He learned how to assemble computers and took on programming jobs for individuals and organizations.

At that time, computers and programming had enormous economic value. He earned around 240,000 RMB, which is still a large sum for a university student even today.

Being able to see the direction of the times, adjust quickly, and then truly learn and execute is a very rare ability. In the 1990s, committing to learning English and programming every day required an exceptional mindset. Even now, I believe these two skills remain critical.

## First Failure: Management, Not Human Nature

His first entrepreneurial attempt—a restaurant—also taught him important lessons.

He treated his employees well, but they stole from the business extensively. At first, he felt angry. Later, after working in Japanese companies, he realized the problem was not just the people, but his management and incentive system.

Being able to admit that your own system is flawed, instead of blaming others, is extremely difficult. Most people instinctively believe it is not their fault. But in reality, poorly designed systems invite failure. You should never test human nature.

---

## Learning from Japanese Companies: Systems Matter

He spent two years working in Japanese companies to repay debt, and he truly learned during that time. He absorbed their approaches to management, sales, and logistics in a very practical way. This period clearly shaped how he later built JD.

## JD’s Core Strategy: Doing the Opposite of the Market

When he started his business again, he observed others carefully and formed a clear strategy:

- no guessing  
- build a real brand  
- provide real service  

He focused on what mattered most to consumers—authentic products, fair pricing, and reliable after-sales service.

These points may sound simple today, but at that time they required real vision in 90s China. When many people were making easy money through deception and zero after-sales responsibility, doing the opposite took courage.

He was scammed multiple times in the process, yet he persisted with a long-term mindset. That is genuinely impressive.

---

## Early Awareness of Scale and Process

He also showed strong business awareness early on.

He mentioned reading many business books, and from the beginning he emphasized standardization, process design, and scalability. This early focus on structure was powerful.

The reputation and trust he built later brought immeasurable benefits. I strongly agree with this point. Deception, shortcuts, and plagiarism do not last in the long run.

---

## Limits and Blind Spots

There are also clear limitations.

During his first venture, he did not understand basic financial concepts like control rights and still went all in. He only learned about venture capital later, during a severe cash-flow crisis, through personal connections.

I sometimes wonder whether deeper financial knowledge, more exposure to English-language information, or experience in Western companies would have made his path smoother.

At the same time, if he had waited until he was fully prepared, he might never have started. Acting early, adjusting while moving, and learning through mistakes can be more effective. Many of the problems he later reflected on are classic business and finance issues. They are all written in books.

I even know many of them myself—but would I really apply them correctly without experience? Probably not. One hard lesson often teaches more than ten books.

Still, I strongly believe that access to international, English-language information is essential. That information flow is irreplaceable.

## Image, Marketing, and “Brother Culture”

After reading the biography, one thing became very clear: Liu Qiangdong is extremely good at marketing himself.

He knows how to shape a public image. The version in the book feels almost too perfect—upright, selfless, and heroic. But how does such a person really exist?

Even ten years ago, JD already had a very strong “brother culture.” The biography describes employees voluntarily working overtime and arriving early, framed as loyalty and brotherhood. It sounds ideal, but in reality, it is very skeptical.

This rigid gender-role mindset is something he seems completely unaware of, and even proud of. That blind spot likely laid the groundwork for the later rape allegations. He embodies a deeply patriarchal worldview and does not recognize women as full, equal individuals.

---

## Founder Scandals and Market Reality

One final observation I found interesting was the timing.

I compared the Minnesota rape case with JD’s stock price. As expected, the stock hit a low during that period. **Negative news about founders can sometimes create strong buying opportunities.**

A founder’s personal scandal is often separate from a company’s operations. Consumers rarely care about the moral image of a founder, unless it directly harms the products or services the company provides.
