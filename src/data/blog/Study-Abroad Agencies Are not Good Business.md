# Study-Abroad Agencies Are not Good Business

## 1. Extremely Low Barriers to Entry

This industry has very low barriers to entry and an excessive number of competitors.

Entry costs are close to zero. Anyone can post on the Internet and start attracting clients. The knowledge barrier is also low. Many people begin taking students without any knowledge about it.

Exit costs are equally low. Even with unstable demand, people can continue operating casually, treating it as a side job rather than a real business.

## 2. No Real Moat

There are only two classic ways to build a moat: differentiation or cost leadership. Study-abroad agencies struggle with both.

### Differentiation Is Weak and Hard to Monetize

Some agencies try to differentiate through:elite university cases; well-known mentors; specialization in narrow fields.

This can create some brand recognition, but it converts poorly into long-term economic value.

The core problems are structural:

### Customer retention is effectively zero.
Clients graduate and disappear. The business is like a leaking pool: you constantly pour water in through customer acquisition, while water leaks out through graduation. Loyalty has little value. Companies are forced into permanent high-intensity sales, and customer acquisition costs remain high.

### Information asymmetry is disappearing.
Universities are making admissions processes more transparent. Platforms and AI are free to use. The old “information advantage” no longer exists.

### Technical barriers are minimal.
The product set is very limited: courses, competitions, activities, essays, tests, interviews. There is little room for deep R&D. Even if something new is developed, competitors can easily copy it. Most so-called “R&D” is actually just polishing sales scripts.

In people-centered, non-standardized industries like management consulting, these three weaknesses are far less severe. Compared to them, study-abroad agencies have much thinner defensibility.

## 3. Cost Leadership Does Not Work Either

### No Scalability

Unlike software, manufacturing, or retail, this industry cannot achieve declining marginal costs. The service needs to be personalized in some ways. 

### Strong Supplier Bargaining Power

The core asset of the business is people. Consultants have very strong bargaining power.

Once experienced, a consultant can leave and start independently at almost zero cost, often taking clients with them. Forward integration is extremely easy.

## 4. The Customer Base Is Changing

Study-abroad agencies traditionally provide three core services:

1. ability and background improvement
    
2. information asymmetry
    
3. emotional reassurance
    

The relevance of these services is shifting.

First, high-performing and highly self-driven students increasingly do not need agencies.  
They can use Internet plus AI tools and often achieve better results than working with consultants. They may still seek help at the final application stage, but their willingness to pay is much lower. Second, information asymmetry is being eliminated. Third, emotional reassurance is growing.

Applications are becoming more competitive, and even ten AI systems cannot eliminate parental anxiety. The service focus is shifting away from educational consulting toward selling certainty and calming fear.

## 5. Incentive Misalignment Inside the Organization

Another structural problem is incentive misalignment within study-abroad agencies.

Sales consultants usually receive a large share of the revenue, while the share allocated to application materials is much smaller. As a result, the teachers responsible for writing and revising essays lack proper incentives to produce truly personalized work.

Without strong incentives, the writing process naturally becomes standardized and assembly-line driven. Personalization is costly in time and effort, but the reward does not justify it. Over time, quality converges toward the minimum acceptable level.

This directly affects client satisfaction. Ironically, customer acquisition relies heavily on sales, yet most customers are one-time clients with no long-term relationship value. The business depends on aggressive sales to acquire short-lived customers, while having little incentive to invest deeply in long-term quality.

Because agencies cannot build long-term shared interests with clients, this mismatch between sales incentives and delivery quality becomes persistent. It is not a temporary operational issue, but a structural flaw in the business model.
