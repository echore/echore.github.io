## About

I use this site to document how I **think, learn, and make decisions**.

I write to clarify my own reasoning, track how my views evolve over time, and leave behind evidence of how I approach uncertainty, trade-offs, and long-term learning. ✍️

## How to Read This Site

If you want a quick sense of how I think, you can start with:

- **Building Things in the Real World**  
  [What I Learned from Building a Small Business](
  /posts/reflections-on-my-entrepreneurial-journey-or-side-hustle/
  ) — products, pricing, sales, SOPs, and why some models don’t scale.

- **Inner Standards & Values**  
  [Inner Scorecard](/posts/inner-scorecard/) — how I evaluate myself independent of external validation.

- **Learning from Mistakes**  
  [What I Learned from Investing](/posts/the-things-i-learned-from-investing/) — early misjudgments, risk awareness, and how my strategy simplified over time.

## What You’ll Find Here

Most of the writing on this site falls into three broad categories:

### Business & Systems  
Notes on how products, pricing, funnels, SOPs, incentives, and collaboration actually work in practice, not just in theory.

### Thinking & Decision-Making  
Mental models, opportunity cost, trade-offs, and how I evaluate choices under constraints.

### Learning by Doing  
Reflections from investing, building small projects, and experimenting with side hustles — including mistakes, misjudgments, and corrections.
